It is my example of some exploits... I wrote it only for Exploit Development Training.
In that repo I put some exploits for vulnerability what I doesn't found.

You can find here:
NSClient++ 0.5.2.35 - Privilege Escalation,
Stack-based buffer overflow in DVD X Player 4.1,
NVMS 1000 - Directory Traversal,
